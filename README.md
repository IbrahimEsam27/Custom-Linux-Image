# Image From Scratch
Building a custom Linux image. It covers toolchain setup, u-boot config, kernel customization, and BusyBox rootfs creation, including setting the init process.
## Project Overview

This endeavor provides an extensive guide and script collection for crafting an embedded Linux system from scratch. Following these steps offers a comprehensive understanding of each element and the holistic process of tailoring a custom Linux distribution for embedded platforms.

## Key Components

### Crosstool-NG

Utilizing [Crosstool-NG](), we construct cross-compilation toolchains tailored to our precise specifications, facilitating efficient software compilation for our target architecture.

---
### U-Boot

[U-Boot]() serves as a prominent bootloader in embedded systems, enabling functionalities like Linux kernel booting, hardware initialization, and debug console provision.

---
### Linux Kernel

At the core of Linux-based OSes, the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) undergoes compilation suited to our target hardware, bespoke configuration, and Device Tree Blobs (DTB) generation for hardware abstraction.

---
### BusyBox

[BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/) amalgamates Unix utilities into a singular executable, furnishing essential commands akin to standard Linux distributions, albeit optimized for resource-constrained environments.

---
### Init Process

Initiating the user-space journey during Linux system boot, a minimalist init process orchestrates vital system initialization tasks, encompassing filesystem mounting, system service initiation, and shell invocation.
